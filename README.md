# Responsive Portfolio
## Description
For this project my main goal was to create a responsive portfolio website using Bootstrap's CSS Framework. 

## Process
I really enjoyed creating this page and drew a lot of inspiration from some really great portfolio sites. I wanted to highlight and link to some relevant things in my current career(bartending) and look forward to adding to this site as I continue to build projects and learn more about web development.
