# Responsive Portfolio
## Objective
For this project my main goal was to create a responsive portfolio website using Bootstrap's CSS Framework. 
I was required to include a `portfolio.html`, `contact.html` and an `index.html` for my code. The `navbar` and `footer` remain consistent through all three pages and contain functional links.
## Process
I really enjoyed creating this page and drew a lot of inspiration from some really great portfolio sites. In the examples provided, the portfolio page contains screenshots of deployed applications, but I wanted to highlight and link to some relevant things in my current career(bartending) and look forward to adding to this site as I continue to build projects throughout the coding bootcamp. 
Throughout my process creating this site, I've definitely gained confidence `commit`ing and `push`ing to GitHub which was something I was struggling with initially. I'm feeling relatively confident in my use of Bootstrap and its grid system. Initially I had some difficulties with the layout, but ultimately I'm pretty happy with where its at now!
